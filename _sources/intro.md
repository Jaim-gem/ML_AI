## An Introduction to Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence

&nbsp; 

**Machine Learning** (ML) is a part of **Artifical Intelligence** (AI) that focuses on *imitating or mimicking human capabilities* like **learning**, **identification**, **vision** and **actions**. It can be applied to navigation, detection, gaming and many other applications.   
&nbsp; 

Here are some **common terms** to get familiar:
&nbsp; 

**Model**<br> 
Relationship between *features* that can be represesented *mathematically*. A *predictive model* can forecast future patterns based on previous data.<br>Models are created in Programming languages like *Python*, *R* and *Java*. 


**Training**<br>
The process of using data to create a model; also called *learning*. 

**Classification**<br>
A prediction method that assigns data to categories. 

**Features**<br>
Variables or observable quantities that are recorded and used by a model. &nbsp; Examples of features that people have are two ears, a nose, a mouth and two legs.
